## Employee Experience
There are three themes for this event around the Credit Suisse __Employee Experience__:
- Experience improvement for Employees (e.g. think parking optimization etc.)
- Developer Experience (e.g. how to accelerate development process, Jenkins CI/CD etc..)
- Business PoV Experience (e.g. Fintech)


If you want to build your prototype on Microsoft Azure (or just learn about the platform), you'll find a few great resources here.
