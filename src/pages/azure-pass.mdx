## Azure Passes

Azure Passes will give you free credits to use the Azure cloud.

Here's what you need to do:

- Go to the event link to get your personal Azure Pass (you will need a GitHub user ID to login):
  - https://azcheck.in/
- Copy the code to the clipboard, then follow the link to https://www.microsoftazurepass.com 
- Login using your **private** Microsoft / Azure account. Create a new one, if required.
- __NOTE__: don't use your company Azure account or ID. This won't work.
- Follow the process
- You should find an __Azure Subscription__ in your account afterwards, called <code>Azure Pass - Sponsorship</code>
